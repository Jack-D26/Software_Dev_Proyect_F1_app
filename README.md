# F1 Drivers Performance Dashboard 🏎️📊

🔗 **[View the live app on Render →](https://app-exploratory-analysis.onrender.com)** _(Update this with the actual link once deployed)_

This project is a personal initiative focused on building a fully functional and interactive web application using **Streamlit**, powered by **real Formula 1 data**. It allows users to visually explore the performance of top F1 drivers from the year 2000 onwards.

---

## Objective

To practice software development tools and web deployment skills by turning exploratory data analysis into a clean, shareable, and engaging web app.

Key goals include:

- Processing and merging multiple raw F1 datasets
- Building dynamic visualizations with Plotly
- Deploying the final Streamlit app to the cloud using Render

This project demonstrates how to transform raw motorsport data into a usable web application with accessible insights. It combines data wrangling, storytelling through visuals, and full-stack deployment skills.

---

## Data Sources

The app uses public datasets covering F1 results from 1950 to 2024. These include:

- `driver_standings.csv`
- `drivers.csv`
- `races.csv`

These were merged using a custom script to create:

- `combined_driver_standings.csv`

---

## Features

The app allows users to:

- View a **horizontal bar chart** of the top 10 drivers by total points since 2000
- Select specific years to display **driver wins** using interactive checkboxes
- Track **cumulative points evolution** per driver using a year slider

All visualizations are interactive and responsive, built with Plotly.
